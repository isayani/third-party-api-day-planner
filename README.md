# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description of Application

This application creates a dynamic daily planner for user. When the planner is opened, the user is presented with the current date and day of the week. There are time blocks for a standard 8 hour work day (9AM - 5PM), the user can click into each box and input a task for the hour. Upon pressing save, the data is stored in local storage. Upon refresh, saved data persists. The time blocks are color coded; past hours are gray, current hour is red and future hours are green.
